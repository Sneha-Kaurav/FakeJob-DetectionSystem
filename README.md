This is a machine learning project that detects fake job based on description of job which includes, salary, experience, education, job-role, job-description, place etc.

EDA and Feature Engineering was done to gather insights from the data.
<br>
Two models were compared viz, RandomForest and XGBoost. The accuracy score for both models were calculated in which XGBoost gave higher accuracy.

Deployed the project on Render and used docker for containerization.
